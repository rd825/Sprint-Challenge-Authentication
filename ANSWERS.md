1. What is the purpose of using _sessions_? <br>
    We face a problem when making API calls: http is stateless, meaning that it doesn't remember things between requests. Sessions gives us a way to rectify that. Sessions allow the server to persist info about the client. For our purposes, we use sessions to remember authentication details. <br> <br> 

2. What does bcrypt do to help us store passwords in a secure manner. <br>
    Instead of saving passwords in plain text (which is a recipe for disaster), we have two options available: encryption and hashing. Bcrypt uses the latter. Hashing is a pure function in which: parameters + input = hash. 


3. What does bcrypt do to slow down attackers? <br>
    In order to slow down attackers, bcrypt can add time to our security algorithm to produce a Key Derivation Function. Bcrypt hashes the password over multiple rounds. This means a hacker needs to have the hash, know the hashing algorithm used, and how many rounds were used to generate the hash to break it.

4. What are the three parts of the JSON Web Token? <br>
    JWTs are composed of a header, payload, and signature. The header declares the type (JWT) and the hashing algorithm. The payload makes claims about the issuer, subject, audience, etc. The signature is a hash of the header, payload, and secret. All of this is base 64 encoded.
